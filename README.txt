This game has raindrops that fall from the top of the screen. There is a catcher that can be moved by the mouse to catch the raindrops. When the catcher catches a raindrop, the score increases by one. If 50 raindrops hit the bottom of the screen, the catcher will disintegrate and the game will end. The acceleration of the raindrops will increase as the game progresses. Also, the raindrops will have small components of horizontal velocity to make the game more difficult.
