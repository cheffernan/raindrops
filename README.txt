This game has raindrops that fall from the top of the screen. There is a catcher that can be moved by the mouse to catch the raindrops. When the catcher catches a raindrop, the score increases by one. If 50 raindrops hit the bottom of the screen, the game will end. Also, the raindrops will have small components of horizontal velocity to make the game more difficult. They will fall down the screen because of a timer. There will be stars, also controlled by a timer, that, if caught, extend your life in the game. The size of the catcher decreases as more raindrops are caught. The game can be restarted once you lose.

NOTE: When I tried out my program at home, the background of the stars was still there. However, at school, it is not. I cannot remove it at home because I do not have Photoshop. When I asked you about it, you said it was OK and I would not get penalized for this glitch.
