This game has raindrops that fall from the top of the screen. There is a catcher that can be moved along the bottom of the screen by the mouse to catch the raindrops. When the catcher catches a raindrop, the score increases by one. If 50 raindrops hit the bottom of the screen, the game will end. Also, the raindrops will have small components of horizontal velocity to make the game more difficult. They will fall down the screen because of a timer. There will be stars, also controlled by a timer, that, if caught, extend your life in the game. The size of the catcher decreases as more raindrops are caught, and the color of the catcher changes based on the number of raindrops missed. The game can be restarted once you lose.

There are a few glitches in my program. First, when I tried out my program at home, the background of the stars was still there. However, at school, it is not. I cannot remove it at home because I do not have Photoshop. Also, because of the shape of the raindrops, the catcher catches them only if they touch the bottom portion of the raindrop, not the triangular top. Lastly, if during the game, the mouse is clicked in the location that the "Try Again" box will be in on the game over screen, the game ends and goes back to the start screen. This should not be a problem though because there is no reason to click the mouse while playing the game.

NOTE: When I asked you about the star background and why it happened, you said it was OK and I would not get penalized for this glitch.
